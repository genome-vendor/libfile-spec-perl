Description: unknown
 PathTools provides functions for determining the pathname of the current
 working directory. It is recommended that getcwd (or another *cwd() function)
 be used in all code to ensure portability.
 .
 By default, it exports the functions cwd(), getcwd(), fastcwd(), and
 fastgetcwd() (and, on Win32, getdcwd()) into the caller's namespace.
 .
 This description was automagically extracted from the module by dh-make-perl.
